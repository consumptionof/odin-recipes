        <p>Ever wanted to make lazy microwave popcorn, but not from a factory bag? <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/87305/microwave-popcorn/"></a>This recipe by Acontorer on Allrecipes</a> will be your jam.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup unpopped popcorn</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>In a cup or small bowl, mix together the unpopped popcorn and oil. Pour the coated corn into a brown paper lunch sack, and sprinkle in the salt. Fold the top of the bag over twice to seal in the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Cook in the microwave at full power for 2 1/2 to 3 minutes, or until you hear pauses of about 2 seconds between pops. Carefully open the bag to avoid steam, and pour into a serving bowl.</li>
        </ol>
